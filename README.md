# Early English Books: An app based on the TEI Processing Model

This application was generated automatically using the [http://showcases.exist-db.org/exist/apps/tei-simple/index.html](TEI Processing Model App Generator). Only the logo and background images have been added afterwards. Apart from this, no code has been modified.

No texts are included in this repo. You can get the full corpus on github: https://github.com/textcreationpartnership/Texts.

Once downloaded, upload the XML documents into collection /db/eebo/EEBO-data/. The app will pick them up there.
